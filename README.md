This React Native project depicts an interesting game to tap on the 3x3 grid cells and check the colored pattern.

**Steps:**
1. Initially, all cells are white.
2. Click on one random cell. It turns to red.
3. If any cell is already having red color, it reverts back to white.
4. It applies to each cell in the grid.
